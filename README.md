# ESN
Train an Echo-State Network with an augmented training algorithm and drive it with a NARMA signal

ESN Implementation imported from: https://github.com/cknd/pyESN/blob/master/pyESN.py
with some changes made.

Initialisation of reservoir weights and input weights done according to Jaeger's paper (offline training),
and implementation of augmented training algorithm following the paper (offline training):
